Prayer of Deliverance by Fr. Gabriele Amorth

O Jesus our Savior, my Lord and my God, my God and my all, 
with your sacrifice on the Cross you redeemed us and defeated the power of Satan. 
I beg you to deliver me from every evil presence and every evil influence.
​

I ask you in your name, I ask you for the sake of your wounds, 
I ask you for the sake of your blood, I ask you for the sake of your Cross, 
I ask you through the intercession of Mary, Immaculate and Sorrowful.
​

May the blood and the water that flow from your side wash over me to purify me, 
deliver me, heal me. 

Amen.
